You see a Google Meet meeting screenshot.
Participants: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Emily, Fred.
If a name is not visible, set audio="unknown" and video="unknown".
If a name is visible, set audio="unmute" and video="medium" by default.
If the video tile is a solid color with one capital letter, set video="off".
Layout rules: if all tiles are the same size, set video="medium" for all visible tiles except "off". If one tile is much larger, set that tile to video="high" and all other visible tiles to "low", except "off".
Audio rule: only if a mute icon is clearly visible, set audio="mute". Otherwise keep audio="unmute".
ONLY output a single JSON: {
"context": { "Alice": {"audio":"mute|unmute|unknown","video":"off|high|medium|low|unknown"}, "Bob": {...}, ...},
}
